# Proportion explained variance
{: #quality_var}

Proportion explained variance gives the ratio of explained variance and target variance. Explained variance is the difference between target variance and variance of prediction error.

## Proportion explained variance at a glance
{: #quality_var-glance}

- **Description**: Proportion explained variance is the ratio of explained variance and target variance. Explained variance is the difference between target variance and variance of prediction error.
- **Default thresholds**: Lower limit = 80%
- **Default recommendation**:
   - **Upward trend**: An upward trend indicates that the metric is improving. This means that model retraining is effective.
   - **Downward trend**: A downward trend indicates that the metric is deteriorating. Feedback data is becoming significantly different than the training data.
   - **Erratic or irregular variation**: An erratic or irregular variation indicates that the feedback data is not consistent between evaluations. Increase the minimum sample size for the Quality monitor.
- **Problem type**: Regression
- **Chart values**: Last value in the time frame
- **Metrics details available**: None



## Do the math
{: #quality_var-math}

The Proportion explained variance is calculated by averaging the numbers, then for each number, subtract the mean and square the results. Then work out the squares

```
                                  sum of squares between groups 
Proportion explained variance =  ________________________________

                                      sum of squares total

# Supported machine learning engines, frameworks, and models
{: #in-ov}

The {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} service supports the following machine learning engines. Each runtime supports models that are created in the following frameworks:

- [{{site.data.keyword.pm_full}}](/docs/services/ai-openscale?topic=ai-openscale-frmwrks-wml#frmwrks-wml)

   You can use {{site.data.keyword.pm_full}} to perform payload logging, feedback logging, and to measure performance accuracy, run-time bias detection, explainability, and auto-debias function in {{site.data.keyword.aios_full}}.

- [Azure ML Studio](/docs/services/ai-openscale?topic=ai-openscale-frmwrks-azure#frmwrks-azure)

   You can use Microsoft Azure ML Studio to perform payload logging, feedback logging, and to measure performance accuracy, run-time bias detection, explainability, and auto-debias function in {{site.data.keyword.aios_full}}.

- [Azure ML Service](/docs/services/ai-openscale?topic=ai-openscale-frmwrks-azureservice#frmwrks-azureservice)

   You can use Microsoft Azure ML Service to perform payload logging, feedback logging, and to measure performance accuracy, run-time bias detection, explainability, and auto-debias function in {{site.data.keyword.aios_full}}.

- [AWS SageMaker](/docs/services/ai-openscale?topic=ai-openscale-frmwrks-aws-sage#frmwrks-aws-sage)

   You can use Amazon SageMaker to perform payload logging, feedback logging, and to measure performance accuracy, run-time bias detection, explainability, and auto-debias function in {{site.data.keyword.aios_full}}.

- [Custom](/docs/services/ai-openscale?topic=ai-openscale-frmwrks-custom#frmwrks-custom)

   You can use your custom machine learning framework to perform payload logging, feedback logging, and to measure performance accuracy, run-time bias detection, explainability, and auto-debias function in {{site.data.keyword.aios_full}}. The custom machine learning framework must have equivalency to {{site.data.keyword.pm_full}}.

- [SPSS C&DS](/docs/services/ai-openscale-icp?topic=ai-openscale-icp-frmwrks-spss#frmwrks-spss) (only available in {{site.data.keyword.wos4d_full}})

   You can use IBM SPSS C&DS to perform payload logging, feedback logging, and to measure performance accuracy, run-time bias detection, explainability, and auto-debias function in {{site.data.keyword.wos4d_full}}.

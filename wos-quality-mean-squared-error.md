# Mean squared error
{: #quality_squerror}

Mean squared error gives the mean of squared difference between model prediction and target value. It can be used as the measure of the quality of an estimator.

## Mean squared error at a glance
{: #quality_squerror-glance}

- **Description**: Mean of squared difference between model prediction and target value
- **Default thresholds**: Upper limit = 80%
- **Default recommendation**:
   - **Upward trend**: An upward trend indicates that the metric is deteriorating. Feedback data is becoming significantly different than the training data.
   - **Downward trend**: A downward trend indicates that the metric is improving. This means that model retraining is effective.
   - **Erratic or irregular variation**: An erratic or irregular variation indicates that the feedback data is not consistent between evaluations. Increase the minimum sample size for the Quality monitor.
- **Problem type**: Regression
- **Chart values**: Last value in the time frame
- **Metrics details available**: None


## Do the math
{: #quality_squerror-math}

The Mean squared error in its simplest form is represented by the following formual.

```
                         SUM  (Yi - ^Yi) * (Yi - ^Yi)
Mean squared errors  =  ____________________________

                             number of errors
```

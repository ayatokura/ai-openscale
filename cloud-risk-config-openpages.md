# Configure model governance with IBM OpenPages MRG ![beta tag](images/beta.png)
{: #mrm-risk-config-openpages}

IBM offers an end-to-end model risk management solution for financial services with {{site.data.keyword.aios_full}} and IBM OpenPages with Watson. IBM OpenPages MRG offers model risk governance that enables you to store and manage a comprehensive model inventory. {{site.data.keyword.aios_full}} monitors and measures outcomes from AI Models across its lifecycle and performs model validations. What is IBM OpenPages Model Risk Governance (MRG)? For more information, see the [IBM OpenPages with Watson product page](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/governance-risk-and-compliance){: external} and the [IBM OpenPages online help](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFUEU_8.0.0/op_grc_user/c_oppm_mrg_intr_module_description.html){: external}.

## Setup options
{: #mrm-risk-config-openpages-options}

You can use one of the following options to set up your initial environment:

- [Automated setup](/docs/services/ai-openscale?topic=ai-openscale-mrm-risk-config-openpages#mrm-risk-config-openpages-auto)
  
  Takes just a few minutes to create a workable system with sample data on a publically hosted lite system

- [Notebook setup](/docs/services/ai-openscale?topic=ai-openscale-mrm-risk-config-openpages#mrm-risk-config-openpages-notebook)
  
  Enables you to control some of the setup parameters and can be used later for managing your own models

- [Manual setup](/docs/services/ai-openscale?topic=ai-openscale-mrm-risk-config-openpages#mrm-risk-config-openpages-manual)
  
  Gives you the most control over resources and options

## Automated setup
{: #mrm-risk-config-openpages-auto}

The auto setup option can be run when you launch the {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} service for the very first time. After you choose auto setup, you must activate the model risk management features by clicking the **Show beta features** ![Show beta features button](/images/wos-show-beta.png) button. The following section details how to run auto setup and activate the beta features on the IBM Cloud environment:

### Prerequisites
{: #mrm-risk-config-openpages-auto-prereqs}

To work with {{site.data.keyword.aios_full}}, you must already have an IBM Cloud instance and you must have provisioned an {{site.data.keyword.aios_full}} instance.

### Steps
{: #mrm-risk-config-openpages-auto-steps}

1. Launch {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}}.
   
   1. From the IBM Cloud Dashboard, click Services.
   2. Click {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}}.
   3. Click the **Launch Application** button.

2. When prompted about running automatic setup, click the **Auto setup** button.
3. From the **Insights** ![The insights dashboard icon](/images/wos_insight-dash-tab.png) dashboard, click the **Show beta features** ![Show beta features button](/images/wos-show-beta.png) button.


## Set up your environment by using a Python noteobok
{: #mrm-risk-config-openpages-notebook}

Let’s get started! Before you begin using the model risk management features, you’ll need to set up the following services on IBM Cloud:

- {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}}, which provides MRM features and metrics 
- Watson Machine Learning (2 separate instances, one for pre-prod and one for prod), which provides the engine for creating predictive models. This tutorial shows how to use Watson Machine Learning as model serving engine, but you can also use any other supported ML engine)
- Watson Studio, which provides the ability to run notebooks and secure assets. (This tutorial shows how to use Watson Studio to create the provided sample models, but you can also use any other IDE to build models.)
- [Optional] Cloud Object Storage, which gives you a place to store model assets, such as training dat1. For the tutorial, you’ll use an internal database, however, you might want to set up Cloud Object Storage for your own work.

For your instance of IBM OpenPages, you must have login credentials to use on an already provisioned system. It is here that you will manage models and view the metrics that are generated by {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}}. To link IBM OpenPages to 
  
### Required file

In addition to the previously mentioned services, you must also have the **OpenScale and OpenPages model risk management on IBM Cloud.ipynb** notebook file, which you can download from the https://github.com/pmservice/ai-openscale-tutorials GitHub repository.

### Create an IBMid and IBM Cloud account

In case you don't have an IBM Cloud account yet, you’ll need to start by creating one.

1. Point your web browser to the following URL: https://cloud.ibm.com/registration
2. Follow instructions to create an IBMid and IBM Cloud Account. 

### Add services to your IBM Cloud account

As soon as you have an IBM Cloud account, you can use the dashboard to add the required services. For each service, you can choose the Lite or Free plan. You must have instances for the following services: {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}}, Watson Studio, and Watson Machine Learning (2 Instances).
 
1. From the Navigation Menu, click Resource list.
2. Click the Create resource button.
3. Search for each of the required services by entering keywords, such as openscale, studio, or machine learning.

You might not be able to add two Lite plan instances of Watson Machine Learning to your account. Either create the second instance using the Watson Machine Learning Standard plan or create a second IBM Cloud Account that is linked to a separate email address to create the second Watson Machine Machine Learning instance (Link to register the second account: https://cloud.ibm.com/registration).
{: note}

### Add a Cloud Object Storage instance

Use Cloud Object Storage to store training dat1. After you create an instance Cloud Object Storage, Watson Studio, Watson Machine Learning, and {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} will be able to access the buckets that are created as part of the model creation process.

1. Use your primary IBMid to log into your IBM Cloud account.
2. From the IBM Cloud Dashboard, click the Add resource button, then click Storage.
3. Click the Object Storage tile, select the Lite plan, then click the Create button.

## Manual setup
{: #mrm-risk-config-openpages-manual}

You can manually set up your entire {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} model risk management service by completing the following steps. To successfully complete the steps, you must have detailed information about your machine learning provider, the database, and the data that is used for monitoring.

### Steps
{: #mrm-risk-config-openpages-manual-steps}

1. [Provision prerequisite IBM Cloud services](/docs/services/ai-openscale?topic=ai-openscale-gs-obj#gs-prps). You must set up two instances of Watson Machine Learning.
2. [Set up Watson Studio projects](/docs/services/ai-openscale?topic=ai-openscale-gs-obj#gs-setup). You must set up projects for both pre-production and production models.
2. [Configure {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}}](/docs/services/ai-openscale?topic=ai-openscale-gs-obj#gs-confaios).
1. Set up model governance by entering the IBM OpenPages credentials and associating an OpenPages model to your {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} model.
   
   1. From the **Insights** dashboard, click **Configure** > **Integrations** > **Edit** to add credentials.
   1. From the model configuration, click **Configure** > **Model governance** > **Edit** to associate an OpenPages model.

2. [Next steps: Continue setting up the monitors and data logging](/docs/services/ai-openscale?topic=ai-openscale-gs-obj#gs-next-steps-config).

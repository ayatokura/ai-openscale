## Use case of {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}}
{: #gs-use}

Traditional lenders are under pressure to expand their digital portfolio of financial services to a larger and more diverse audience, which requires a new approach to credit risk modeling. Their data science teams currently rely on standard modeling techniques - like decision trees and logistic regression - which work well for moderate datasets, and make recommendations that can be easily explained. This satisfies regulatory requirements that credit lending decisions must be transparent and explainable.

To provide credit access to a wider and riskier population, applicant credit histories must expand beyond traditional credit, like mortgages and car loans, to alternate credit sources like utility and mobile phone plan payment histories, plus education and job titles. These new data sources offer promise, but also introduce risk by increasing the likelihood of unexpected correlations which introduce bias based on an applicantâ€™s age, gender, or other personal traits.

The data science techniques most suited to these diverse datasets, such as gradient boosted trees and neural networks, can generate highly accurate risk models, but at a cost. Such "black box" models generate opaque predictions that must somehow become transparent, to ensure regulatory approval such as Article 22 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) managed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

The credit risk model provided in this tutorial uses a training dataset that contains 20 attributes about each loan applicant. Two of those attributes - age and sex - can be tested for bias. For this tutorial, the focus will be on bias against sex and age. For more information about training data, see [Why does {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} need access to my training data?](/docs/services/ai-openscale?topic=ai-openscale-trainingdata#trainingdata)

{{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} will monitor the deployed model's propensity for a favorable outcome ("No Risk") for one group (the Reference Group) over another (the Monitored Group). In this tutorial, the Monitored Group for sex is `female`, while the Monitored Group for age is `19 to 25`.

## Setup options
{: #gs-module}

There are several setup options, depending on your preference and level of expertise.

- [The following automated setup](/docs/services/ai-openscale?topic=ai-openscale-wos-fast-start#wos-fast-start) guides you through the process by performing tasks for you in the background.

   Use of a tour means that you can watch and click through to the next part of the tour.
   
- [The interactive setup](/docs/services/ai-openscale?topic=ai-openscale-gs-obj#gs-obj) lets you take control with an easy-to-follow script.

   Use the interface to perform common tasks with a sample model and injected data.
   
- [The advanced tutorial](/docs/services/ai-openscale?topic=ai-openscale-crt-ov) enables more technical users to install a Python module that automates the provisioning and configuration of prerequisite services. This advanced tutorial is for data scientists or users who are comfortable with coding, Python and Notebooks. It's an example of how the {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} client can be used to perform functionality programatically. The notebook that is used in this tutorial results in the same place as following the [automated setup](/docs/services/ai-openscale?topic=ai-openscale-wos-fast-start#wos-fast-start).

   This module requires that Python 3 is installed, which includes the pip package management system. For instructions, see, [Installing a Python module to set up {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}}](/docs/services/ai-openscale?topic=ai-openscale-as-module).

For additional tutorial links, see [Additional resources](/docs/services/ai-openscale?topic=ai-openscale-arsc-ov).

## Automated setup
{: #wos-fast-start}

To quickly see how {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} monitors a model, run the demo scenario option that is provided when you first log into the {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} UI.  See [Working with the UI demo](#wos-work-demo).
{: shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #wos-prereqs}

Before you begin the tour, you must have the following resources set up:

- [{{site.data.keyword.ibmid}}](/docs/account?topic=account-signup){: external}
- [{{site.data.keyword.aios_full}}](/docs/services/ai-openscale?topic=ai-openscale-gettingstarted#crt-wos-faststart)

The automated setup tour is designed to work with the least possible user interaction. It automatically makes the following decisions for you:

- If you have multiple {{site.data.keyword.pm_full}} instances set up, the install process runs an API call to list the instances and chooses whichever {{site.data.keyword.pm_short}} instance appears first in the resulting list. 
- To create a new lite version {{site.data.keyword.pm_full}}, {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} installer uses the default resource group for your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} account.

### Provision a {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} service
{: #crt-wos-faststart}

If you haven't already, ensure that you provision {{site.data.keyword.aios_full}}.

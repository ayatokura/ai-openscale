## Use case and the value of {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}}

A biomedical company that produces heart drugs has collected data about a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of four medications. The company is using this data to build an AI assistant for medical practitioners, which will recommend the drug it believes to be the best choice for the patient.

The model uses patient data fields AGE, SEX, BP (blood pressure), CHOLESTEROL, K (potassium levels), and NA (sodium levels) to predict one of four values for the DRUG data field.

  ![Drug tutorial overview](images/drug-tutorial-overview.png)

### How {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} can help

- *Identify run-time bias in the model*: The company has established evidence that shows the key factors that should influence which drug is predicted are BP, CHOLESTEROL, K and NA. AGE and SEX do play a role, but they're not as significant when compared to the other indicators. The company suspects that the data coming from patient trials might have suffered from biases of the practitioners for prescribing medications based on SEX and BP. The company wants to constantly monitor for such biases being learned from the data, and flag a suspected bias.

- *Constantly validate the accuracy of the model*: The company routinely evaluates the model prediction by having experts provide their own drug recommendations based on the patient data. The goal is to integrate these manual evaluations as feedback, to tell the model in real time where it might be wrong, and improve it over time.

- *Make the model more trustworthy*: To achieve a successful adoption of its AI assistant, the company received feedback from its customer base of medical practitioners and doctors who said they would not trust the AI model recommendations without understanding the logic behind them.

Each of these issues will be addressed in this tutorial, through the use of {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}}:

- The Fairness monitor will flag SEX and BP biases the model may have
- The Accuracy monitor uses feedback generated by your experts to test the performance of the deployed model, to detect model drift

## Alternate setup option

  You may see a screen similar to the below. As you will be using a GUI method to score your data, simply select the **Configure monitors** button to complete this set-up.

  ![Select database](images/gs-config-send-scoring.png)

### Provide a set of sample data to your model

- Before you can configure your monitors, you must generate at least one scoring request against your model, in order to generate payload logging that the monitors can consume.

- To generate the scoring request, download the [drug_train_data.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/watson-developer-cloud/doc-tutorial-downloads/master/ai-openscale/drug_train_data.json) file.

- From the **Deployments** tab of your Watson Studio project, click the **drug-test-deploy** link, click the **Test** tab, and select the JSON input icon.

  ![JSON test](images/json_test02.png)

- Now, open the `drug_train_data.json` file you downloaded, and copy the contents to the JSON field in the **Test** tab. Click the **Predict** button to send and score training payloads to your model.

  ![JSON predict](images/json_test03.png)

### Preparing for monitoring

1.  Now, in your {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} instance, select your deployment, then select the *Prepare for monitoring* tile, and click **Begin**.

    ![Prepare for monitoring](images/config-prep-monitor.png)

1.  Now you will provide information about your model and training data; click **Next**.

    ![Prepare explanation](images/config-what-monitor.png)

1.  From the drop-down menu, select *Numeric/categorical* as the type of data your deployment analyzes, and click **Next**.

    ![Select input type](images/config-input-monitor.png)

1.  For numeric or categorical data, you need to provide information about the training data for your model, in order to configure the monitors. Select **Manually configure monitors** to provide connection information to your training data

    ![Select config type](images/config-manual-monitor.png)

1.  Select the [algorithm type](/docs/services/ai-openscale/monitor-accuracy.html#understand-accuracy), and click **Next**:

    ![Multi-class](images/multiclass.png)

1.  The Db2 location information for the sample data is already pre-populated on this screen - simply select **Next** to continue.

    ![Specify Db2 location of training data page](images/gs-config-train-db2-monitor.png)

1.  The Schema and Table are also pre-populated:

    ![Specify Db2 location of schema and training table](images/gs-fair-config-table-db2.png)

    Click **Next** to proceed.

1.  Now, you must specify which column from the table contains prediction values (labels). In this case, it's the **DRUG** column, so select that one and click **Next**.

1.  Select the columns used to train the model these are the features that your model deployment expects in a request. All the data columns are inputs to the model. Select all inputs and click **Next**:

    ![Explainability Inputs](images/explain_inputs1.png)

1.  For categorical features, you must identify columns which now contain integers, but originally contained text values. Select **SEX**, **BP**, and **CHOLESTEROL** only; neither **AGE**, **NA**, nor **K** contained text. Review your input and click **Save**.

1.  Review your selection summary and click **Save** to continue.

### Configure Fairness monitoring

- Select  **Fairness** and click **Begin**.

- Read about fairness and click **Next**. For more information, see [Understanding Fairness](/docs/services/ai-openscale/monitor-fairness.html#understand-fair).

<!---
- Specify the location of the model training data by selecting **Db2** from the **Location** menu and filling out the remaining fields with the Db2 credentials created earlier before clicking **Next**.

- Once the database is connected, select your schema and the training data table in the menus, then click **Next**. Note that the data in the table should be in the format expected by the scoring endpoint, with an additional column containing the prediction values:

  ![Schema Selection](images/schema_select.png)

--->

- You may now choose which features to monitor for fairness. In this example, we'll monitor the **SEX** and **BP** (*blood pressure*) features. Click the **SEX** and **BP** tiles, and click **Next**.

- {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} works to detect bias against a monitored group in comparison to a reference group. For the **SEX** feature, add the value `M` (*male*) to the **Reference group**, and the value `F` (*female*) to the **Monitored group**, and click **Next**:

  ![Gender Groups](images/gender_groups1.png)

  The model will be flagged as biased for **SEX** if the drug prediction ratios for the monitored group differ from the ratios for the reference group. So if the model predicts drug X for male patients 60% of the time, and for female patients 20% of the time, it is biased.

- You may now assign a fairness threshold for **SEX**. You will see an alert on your operations dashboard if the Fairness rating falls below this threshold. Set the threshold at 90%, and click **Next**.

- For the **BP** feature, add the value `HIGH` to the **Reference group**, and the values `LOW` and `NORMAL` to the **Monitored group**, and click **Next**:

  ![Gender Groups](images/bp_groups.png)

  As with **SEX**, the model will be flagged as biased for **BP** if the drug prediction ratios for the monitored group differ from the ratios for the reference group. So if patients with normal blood pressure receive a drug at a different ratio than patients with low or high blood pressure, the model is biased.

- Set the threshold for **BP** at 90%, and click **Next**.

- You will now select Favorable and Unfavorable prediction values from the payload logging (PostgreSQL) database. {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} automatically detects which column in the payload logging data contains the prediction values, and presents them in the "Values from training data" section.

  For this tutorial, those values are **drugA**, **drugB**, **drugC**, and **drugX**. Drag and drop **drugA** and **drugC** as favorable values, and the others as unfavorable values, to the form and click **Next**:

  ![Positive and negative values](images/pos_and_neg2.png)

- Use the slider to adjust the minimum sample size to 100, then click  **Next**. Review your choices, and then click **Save**.

  ![Positive and negative values](images/fair-summary.png)

  **Note**: For purposes of this tutorial, the minimum sample size has been set to 100. Normally, a larger sample size is recommended to ensure the sample size is not too small to skew results.

  You will see the below screen that provides a debiased scoring endpoint. As you will be using a GUI method score your data, simply select **Close** to continue.

  ![Debias API](images/gs-insight-debias-api.png)

### Configure accuracy monitoring

- Select **Accuracy** and click **Begin**.

- Read about accuracy and click **Next**. For more information, see [Accuracy - How it works](/docs/services/ai-openscale/monitor-accuracy.html#how-it-works).

- Set the accuracy threshold to 90% and click **Next**.

- On the next screen, use the slider to adjust the minimum sample size to 10, then click  **Next**.

  **Note**: For purposes of this tutorial, the minimum sample size has been set to 10. Normally, a larger sample size is recommended to ensure the sample size is not too small to skew results.

- For the maximum sample size, use 10000. Click **Next**.

- You can review your choices before clicking **Save** to finalize them.

- Finally, you're presented with an optional button to **Add Feedback Data**, along with feedback logging code snippets. See [Configuring the Accuracy monitor](/docs/services/ai-openscale/monitor-accuracy.html#config-accuracy) for details. For now, select **Close** without pressing this button.

<!---

### Configure explainability monitoring

- Select **Explainability** and click **Begin**.

- Read about explainability and click **Next**. For more information, see [Explainability](/docs/services/ai-openscale/monitor-explain.html).

- Select the type of data the deployment analyzes. The sample model receives numeric or categorical data, so select **Numeric/categorical** from the menu and click **Next**. For the sample model, an example of numeric data would be the `AGE` data column, such as `54`, while an example of categorical data would be the `CHOLESTEROL` data column, such as `NORMAL`.

- The training data is located in the Db2 Warehouse instance created earlier. Add the credentials in the form, **Test** the connection, and then click **Next**.

- To identify the location of the training table, set the schema to your Db2 Warehouse username, set the table to **CAR\_RENTAL\_TRAINING**, and click **Next**:

  ![Explainability Schema](images/explain_schema.png)

- Next, select the **Action** column, as it contains the prediction values from the machine learning service, and click **Next**.

- Next, select the [algorithm type](/docs/services/ai-openscale/monitor-accuracy.html#understand-accuracy). For the sample algorithm, there are multiple possible outcomes (four drug predictions), so select **Multi-class Classification** from the menu and click **Next**:

  ![Multi-class](images/multiclass.png)

- All the data columns are inputs to the model. Select all inputs and click **Next**:

  ![Explainability Inputs](images/explain_inputs1.png)

- For categorical features, neither **AGE**, **NA**, nor **K** contained text, so click **Next** without selecting any tiles. Review your input and click **Save**.

- You have finished configuring {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}}. It will now monitor your models and provide real-time bias detection, accuracy, and explainability. In the next steps, you will provide sample data for it to analyze.

## Connect your payload logging table to Watson Studio

- From the **Assets** tab in your Watson Studio project, click the **Add to project** button and select **Connection** from the menu:

  ![Add Connection](images/add_connection.png)

- A list of your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Services will appear. Select the Db2 instance you created earlier, and the click **Create**. You can now add the data from this database to your project. Click **Add to project** again, and selected **Connected assets**:

  ![Add Connected Asset](images/add_connected_assets.png)

- Click the **Select source** link and choose your Db2 Warehouse instance, schema, and the HEART\_DRUG\_TRAINING table, then click **Select**.

  ![Connection Source](images/connection_source1.png)

- Give your asset a name, then click **Create**.

- Now add the PostgreSQL database. In your Watson Studio project, click **Add to project** and select **Connection**.

- Select the PostgreSQL instance you created earlier and click **Create**.

- Now add the payload logging table from PostgreSQL to Watson Studio. First, find the deployment ID for your model. From the **Deployments** tab of your Watson Studio project, click the **drug-test-deploy** link. On the **Overview** tab, scroll down and make note of the model ID:

  ![Model ID](images/model_id1.png)

- From the **Assets** tab of your Watson Studio project, click **Add to project** and select **Connected assets** from the menu. Click the **Select source** button and choose your PostgreSQL instance and the **public** schema.

- The payload logs are named _Payload\_\<model id\>_. Locate the one that matches the drug-selection model. Click **Select**, give the table a name, and click **Create**:

  ![Named Asset Connection](images/named_asset_connection1.png)

- With the model payload added as a data asset within Watson Studio, it's now easy to share, visualize and analyze. The payload table is currently empty. Next, you will provide some data for your model to analyze.

--->

## Provide a set of sample feedback data to your model

- To enable monitoring for accuracy, you must retrain and redeploy your model with feedback data; no accuracy data will appear in the dashboard until this is done. You can generate these requests all at once by feeding sample feedback data to the model for scoring.

- Download the [drug_feedback_data.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/watson-developer-cloud/doc-tutorial-downloads/master/ai-openscale/drug_feedback_data.csv) file.

- In {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}}, click the **Insights** tab:

  ![Insights](images/insight-dash-tab.png)

- Click the tile for your deployed model.

  ![Insights tab - no data](images/gs-insight-overview.png)

- Then, click the icon to edit the deployment configuration:

  ![Edit icon - right side](images/gs-insight-edit-icon.png)

- In the "Summary" side panel, select the **Add Feedback Data** button, and select the `drug_feedback_data.csv` file you downloaded. Set the delimiter to "Comma(,)". Click **OK** when complete.

  ![Accuracy delimiter](images/accuracy-delimit.png)

  **Note**: File sizes are currently limited to 8 MB.

  Adding the CSV file retrains and provides feedback data to your model.

  ![Summary panel](images/gs-insight-summary-panel-2.png)

- Finally, in Watson Studio, [re-run the sample data set](/docs/services/ai-openscale/getting-started.html#provide-a-set-of-sample-data-to-your-model) against the updated model. This will re-train and re-score your model.

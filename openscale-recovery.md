# High availability and disaster recovery
{: #openscale-availability-recovery}

{{site.data.keyword.aios_full}} supports high availability with no single point of failure, however, clients are responsible for backing up their own data.
{: shortdesc}

##High Availability 
{: #openscale-high-availability}

{{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} is deployed and available on **us-south** data centers with multiple zone routing (MZR) on three availability zones. At any time, if one zone is not available, the system will continue to be available in other availability zones. The global-load balancer and DNS server routes traffic to available zones without any user interruption.

Data that is stored in PostgreSQL databases is also highly available and exists in multiple availability zones. It is, however, the customerâ€™s responsibility to back up data in support of a disaster recovery plan so that services can be re-created.

{{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} traffic is load-balanced across multiple zones in a region. Each zone is a data center in the same region. See [How do I ensure zero downtime? ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-zero-downtime#zero-downtime){: new_window} for more information.

Compose databases, such as PostgreSQL and distributed <code>etc</code> directory (etcd) databases are backed up periodically to ensure high availability and, in the event of disaster, the {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} operations team will be able to recover service within Recovery Point Objective (RPO).
 
The Cloud Service offers in-region data redundancy enabling high availability protection. IBM provides automatic data replication for Client databases which contain training and/or custom model data at no additional cost. Replication is completed across in-region availability zones within IBM Cloud data centers.
 
## Backup & Restore
{: #openscale-restore}

Clients are responsible for backing up and restoring their own data, including training and/or custom model data as well as any Client generated custom models. For Client backup and restore instructions, please see the Cloud Service documentation.
 
##Disaster Recovery
{: #openscale-disaster-recovery}

In-region Business Continuity is completed by leveraging the automatic replication across in-region availability zones within IBM Cloud data centers. Clients are responsible for multi-region Disaster Recovery. The responsibilities include backing up, restoring and synching of their own security policies, training and/or custom model data as well as any Client generated custom models. In addition, the client is responsible for routing and/or load balancing across the regions. For Client backup and restore instructions, please see the Cloud Service documentation.

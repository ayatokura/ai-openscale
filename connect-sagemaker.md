# Specifying an Amazon SageMaker ML service instance
{: #csm-connect}

Your first step in the {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} tool is to specify an Amazon SageMaker service instance. Your Amazon SageMaker service instance is where you store your AI models and deployments.
{: shortdesc}

You can also add your machine learning provider by using the Python SDK. For more information on performing this programmatically, see [Bind your Amazon SageMaker machine learning engine](/docs/services/ai-openscale?topic=ai-openscale-cml-connect#cml-smbind).

## Connect your Amazon SageMaker service instance
{: #csm-config}

{{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} connects to AI models and deployments in an Amazon SageMaker service instance.

1.  From the home page of the {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} tool, click **Begin**.

    ![Select Amazon SageMaker service](images/connect-sage.png)

1.  Enter your credentials:

    - Access Key ID: Your AWS access key ID, `aws_access_key_id`, which verifies who you are and authenticates and authorizes calls that you make to AWS.
    - Secret Access Key: Your AWS secret access key, `aws_secret_access_key`, which is required to verify who you are and to authenticate and authorize calls that you make to AWS.
    - Region: Enter the region where your Access Key ID was created. Keys are stored and used in the region in which they were created and cannot be transferred to another region.Â

# Sending a scoring request
{: #cdb-score}

To configure monitors, {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} requires you to send a scoring payload, in order to begin to log the data that will be monitored.
{: shortdesc}

- For models deployed in {{site.data.keyword.pm_full}}, you have to score your model using {{site.data.keyword.pm_full}} API. The scoring payload is automatically sent to {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} when you score the model.
- For other machine learning engines, such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon SageMaker, or a custom machine learning engine the scoring payload must be sent using the Payload Logging API. For more information, see [Payload logging for non-{{site.data.keyword.pm_full}} service instances](/docs/services/ai-openscale?topic=ai-openscale-cml-connect).

## Steps for payload logging
{: #cdb-score-apisteps}

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} dashboard, click a deployment tile.
2. Click **Configure monitors** . 
3. In the navigation pane, click **Payload logging**.
2. Choose whether to use the `cURL` or `Python` code by clicking the `cURL` or `Python` tab.
3. Click **Copy to clipboard** and paste it into to log model deployment request and response data. For more information, see [Payload logging for non-{{site.data.keyword.pm_full}} service instances](/docs/services/ai-openscale?topic=ai-openscale-cml-connect).

The fields and values in the code snippets need to be substituted with your real values, as the ones provided are only examples.

After you run your payload logging, a checkmark appears in the **Ready to Monitor** column for the selected deployment. Click **Configure Monitors** to continue.

## Understanding the number of scoring requests
{: #cdb-score-capacity}

Scoring requests are an integral part of {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} processing. Each transaction record that you send to the model to be scored generates additional processing so that the {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} service can perform perturbation and create explanations.

- For tabular, text, or image models the following baseline request generates data points:

   - 1 scheduling service scoring request generates 5000 data points.

- For tabular classification models only, there are additional scoring requests that are made for contrastive explanation. The following requests are added to the preceding baseline request:

   - 100 scoring requests generates 51 additional data points per request.
   - 101 scoring requests generates 1 additional data point per request.

# Custom machine learning engine
{: #fmrk-workaround-customengine}

A custom machine learning engine provides the infrastructure and hosting capabilities for machine learning models and web applications. Custom machine learning engines that are supported by {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} must conform to the following requirements:

- Expose two types of REST API endpoints:

   * discovery endpoint (GET list of deployments and details)
   * scoring endpoints (online and real-time scoring)

- All endpoints need to be compatible with the swagger specification to be supported.

- Input payload and output to or from the deployment must be compliant with the JSON file format that is described in the specification.

At this stage only the `BasicAuth` or `none` formats are supported.
{: Note}

The following example shows the REST API endpoints specification:

## When is a custom machine learning engine the best choice for me?
{: #fmrk-workaround-enging-choice}

A custom machine learning engine is the best choice when the following situations are true:

- You are not using any available out-of-the-box products to serve your machine learning models. You have just developed your own system to do that. There is no, and will be no, direct support in {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} for that.
- The serving engine you are using from a 3rd-party supplier is not supported by {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} yet. In this case, consider developing a custom machine learning engine as a wrapper to your original or native deployments.

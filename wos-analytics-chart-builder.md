Use the {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} chart builder to create custom visualizations, so you can better understand model predictions and inputs at run time. The chart builder displays the output of the modelâ€™s prediction against the features or data ranges that a business considers important. It helps uncover new trends in the data, which might prompt the business and data science teams to consider changes to the AI model.

   You can also see how confident the model predicts within this range of credit history. You can analyze the scoring payload that is sent to your deployment in the selected data range by custom chart (selecting between features, prediction classes, and confidence).

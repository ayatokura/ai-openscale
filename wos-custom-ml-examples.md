# Custom machine learning engine examples
{: #fmrk-workaround-cstmmlsengex}

Use the following examples to set up your own custom machine learning engine.
{: shortdesc}

## Python and flask
{: #fmrk-workaround-pandflask}

The [Custom ML Engine example published on git](https://github.com/pmservice/ai-openscale-tutorials/tree/master/applications/custom-ml-engine-bluemix) is using python and flask to serve scikit-learn model.

To generate the drift detection model, you must use scikit-learn version 0.20.2 in the notebook. 
{: note}

The [README file](https://github.com/pmservice/ai-openscale-tutorials/tree/master/applications/custom-ml-engine-bluemix) describes how the app can be deployed locally for testing purposes as well as cf application on IBM Cloud. The implementation of REST API endpoints can be found in [app.py file](https://github.com/pmservice/ai-openscale-tutorials/blob/master/applications/custom-ml-engine-bluemix/app.py).

## Node.js
{: #fmrk-workaround-nodejs}

You can also find example of custom machine learning engine written in [Node.js here](https://github.com/pmservice/ai-openscale-tutorials/tree/master/applications/custom-ml-engine-nodejs).

## End2end code pattern
{: #fmrk-workaround-e2ecode}

[Code pattern](https://developer.ibm.com/patterns/monitor-custom-machine-learning-engine-with-ai-openscale) showing end2end example of custom engine deployment and integration with {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}}.

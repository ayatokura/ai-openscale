## GHE issue tracker (with doc issues label)

One of the brilliant aspects of the way that Watson OpenScale is set up from an operations point of view is the consistent use of a single GitHub repository to track all work for all squads, including documentation. The following link is for issues that are tagged [`Documentation`](https://github.ibm.com/aiopenscale/tracker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ADocumentation).

## Offering managers

Taken from [Beth Smith's blog](https://w3-connections.ibm.com/blogs/76f4974e-15fb-41d1-8fa5-5ad4abc1ae4d/entry/Team_announcements_Joining_Analytics_and_AI)

AI lifecycle tools & runtime: We are combining Watson Studio, Watson Machine Learning, and OpenScale as a comprehensive set of tools and runtimes for AI, running on Kubernetes. This team will work closely with IBM Research to deliver AI automation throughout the lifecycle.
The offering management team for AI OpenScale will move to Shadi Copty and includes the following OMs:

- Alex Jones
- Rebecca Kim (metrics)
- Rohan Vaidyanathan w/ his team (marketing/go to market)


## Design

- Thomas Hollifield (manager/lead)
- Kim Iungerman (project manager, chairs the Design 4 in a Box meeting)
- Kev Bittner
- Cory Marko

## Slack channels

- `#openscale` (general)
- `#openscale-api` (api channel)
- `#openscale-dev` (main dev channel)
- `#openscale-doc` (main documentation channel)
- `#openscale-support` (main support channel, monitored by the dev team)
- `#openscale-tool` (questions about the fastpath/python module/Yong's dev team)
- `#openscale-ux` (questions for the design/ux team, Thomas Hollifield's team)


## Translations

Translation kits are sent once a month on the last Monday of each month. Translation process, which includes contacts and a link to the spreadsheet where we enter translation shipments: https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/developing/writing?topic=writing-tp#tp

OpenScale, by request, has a lot of screencaps that are difficult to maintain for English, let alone in translations. I explained the situation to Rishi and feel the best option would be to provide English screencaps and if the translators wanted to reproduce them with translated interfaces, they were certainly welcome to do that but that the documentation team doesn't have the resources to provide translatable SVGs.

We discussed the feasibility of development providing translated screen captures and updates to them as a way to help manage the frequent GUI updates that OpenScale has had.

### Project codes for translation kits

The following screen shots show you how to fill out the TCT Light screens for the translation kits:

## Accessibility testing

The documentation has been tested. [IBM Watson OpenScale Documentation Accessibility Checklist](https://acs.w3ibm.mybluemix.net/auth/checklist?checklistId=4b1cfcec-5ee8-4fdf-8a0f-04f80e4a6643&deliverableId=34dd21a8-e5d8-473f-902e-c0980ccb8418)

Link to Cloud doc about ACS compliance records, https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/developing/writing?topic=writing-accessibility-requirements-for-information-developers#step-7-submitting-your-checklists-and-compliance-records-in-acs


I assume accessibility requirements are the same regardless of where documentation is published, but FWIW, here's a link to the IBM Cloud doc app info, which might be specific to how to test for repos in the Cloud doc app, https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/developing/writing?topic=writing-accessibility-requirements-for-information-developers#downloading-content-for-testing


Note:
In the section, What does this mean for service providers?, it says:
>The compliance for your service in IBM Cloud (UI or doc) will be recorded in ACS in such a way that your compliance is dependent on IBM Cloud's compliance. Use the statements from the corporate team in this section.
>However, the IBM Cloud compliance is not affected if your service becomes non-compliant.
Last year, the doc app itself wasn't compliant, so technically a service's documentation couldn't be completely compliant either. Now, as far as I know the doc app is compliant.


## Content quality efforts

Documentation in the IBM Cloud doc app is subject to certain processes set by the doc app team (Jenifer Schlotfeldt's team), one of which is automated testing for the content quality dashboard (aka, CQD) and quarterly "doc week" reporting.
Info about CQD: https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/developing/writing/content-strategy?topic=writing-cqd#cqd-tc-md
There's a Slack channel for #doc-week-2019 https://ibm-cloudplatform.slack.com/archives/C89B4RALE/p1550524701002600


## Amplitude 

The Amplitude dashboard is available [here](https://analytics.amplitude.com/ibm/dashboard/vcz3hrj). You can view usage charts for the OpenScale content.

### Request for instrumentation for getting started tutorial

One of the OMs, Rebecca Kim, has an issue created for getting stats about the getting started tutorial

## Conrefs used in Watson OpenScale content

The following conrefs (variables) are used extensively throughout the documentation. It is good to be familiar with them. Some have both `short` and `full` forms. Some even have the `notm` form, which strips any copyright or trademark symbols out of the string so that they can be used in headings. Use of the escape characters for the copyright and trademark symbols in a heading causes problems and must be avoided.

- `{{site.data.keyword.aios_full}}` = IBMÂ® Watson OpenScale
- `{{site.data.keyword.aios_full_notm}}` = IBM Watson OpenScale
- `{{site.data.keyword.aios_short}}` = Watson OpenScale
- `{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}` = IBM Cloudâ„¢
- `{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}` = IBM Cloud
- `{{site.data.keyword.cos_full}}` = IBMÂ® Cloud Object Storage
- `{{site.data.keyword.dashdblong}}` = IBMÂ® Db2Â® Warehouse on Cloud
- `{{site.data.keyword.DSX}}` = Watson Studio
- `{{site.data.keyword.iamshort}}` = Cloud Identity and Access Management
- `{{site.data.keyword.ibmid}}` = IBMid
- `{{site.data.keyword.ibmwatson_notm}}` = IBM Watson
- `{{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull_notm}}` = IBM Cloud Pak for Data
- `{{site.data.keyword.icpfull}}` = IBMÂ® Cloud Private
- `{{site.data.keyword.pm_full}}` = IBM Watsonâ„¢ Machine Learning
- `{{site.data.keyword.pm_short}}` = Machine Learning
- `{{site.data.keyword.wos4d_full}}` = IBMÂ® Watson OpenScale for IBMÂ® Cloud Pak for Data
- `{{site.data.keyword.wos4d_notm}}` = IBM Watson OpenScale for IBM Cloud Pak for Data

If you ever need to check on the value of one of these conref variables, or if you need to look up another one to use, see [IBM Cloud conref equivalent file to cloudoeconrefs.dita](https://github.ibm.com/cloud-doc-build/markdown/blob/master/cloudoeconrefs.yml)

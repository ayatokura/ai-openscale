# Logarithmic loss
{: #quality_log_loss}

Logarithmic loss gives the mean of logarithms target class probabilities (confidence). It is also known as Expected log-likelihood and is an effective measure of model performance.

## Logarithmic loss at a glance
{: #quality_log_loss-glance}

- **Description**: Mean of logarithms target class probabilities (confidence). It is also known as Expected log-likelihood.
- **Default thresholds**: Lower limit = 80%
- **Default recommendation**:
   - **Upward trend**: An upward trend indicates that the metric is deteriorating. Feedback data is becoming significantly different than the training data.
   - **Downward trend**: A downward trend indicates that the metric is improving. This means that model retraining is effective.
   - **Erratic or irregular variation**: An erratic or irregular variation indicates that t The feedback data is not consistent between evaluations. Increase the minimum sample size for the Quality monitor.
- **Problem type**: Binary classification and multiclass classification
- **Chart values**: Last value in the time frame
- **Metrics details available**: None

## Do the math
{: #quality_log_loss-math}

For a binary model, Logarithmic loss is calculated by using the following formula:

```
-(y log(p) + (1-y)log(1-p))
```

where p = true label and y = predicted probability

For a multi-class model, Logarithmic loss is calculated by using the following formula:

```
  M
-SUM Yo,c log(Po,c)
 c=1 
```

where M > 2, p = true label, and y = predicted probability

Youâ€™ll use IBM Watson OpenScale to validate and monitor your models and to process metrics and KPIs. First, you need to do some set up.
Step 1: Activate model risk management features
As part of the closed beta cohort, you can activate the model risk management beta features on IBM Watson OpenScale. The following sections detail how to activate the beta features on the IBM Cloud and the IBM Cloud Pak for Data environments:
On IBM Cloud
To work with IBM Watson OpenScale, you must already have an IBM Cloud instance and you must have provisioned an IBM Watson OpenScale instance.
1.	Launch Watson OpenScale.
a.	From the IBM Cloud Dashboard, click Services.
b.	Click Watson OpenScale
c.	Click the Launch Application button.
2.	When prompted about running automatic setup, click the No thanks button.
3.	From the Insights dashboard, add the following to the URL: ?mrm=true
After you append the variable, the URL should look like the following sample: https://aiopenscale.cloud.ibm.com/aiopenscale/insights?mrm=true
Step 2: Perform analysis in Watson OpenScale
After you run the set-up notebook and activate the MRM beta features, you can both see and compare the sample evaluations in Watson OpenScale. There is a downloadable report, the Model Summary Report, that includes all the quality measures, fairness measures, and drift magnitude.
1.	From the Insights dashboard, click the model deployment tile
2.	From the Actions drop-down box, click one of the following analysis options:
a.	Past evaluations: Lists all the previous versions of the evaluation. 
b.	Compare: Compare any of the models, but especially versions of the same model, for best performance.
c.	Download report PDF: Generates the model summary report, which gives you all of the metrics and the explanation for why they were scored the way they were. 
Deploy a new model to production in Watson OpenScale
Push the best model to production. Create a production record by importing from a pre-production model. After the model is approved for deployment in IBM OpenPages, you can send the model to production in Watson OpenScale. 
1.	Review the status of the model deployment:

 

2.	Return to the sample beta notebook and run the cells to send the model to production.
3.	You can now view the production model deployment tile. In a regular production environment, it initially appears empty until enough data is gathered and time has passed for metric calculation to be triggered. For the beta, the notebook adds data and runs the monitors so that you can see the results right away.

 

Use the analysis of fairness to redefine the model, possibly by using a different algorithm. 
Watson OpenScale enables you to compare models by looking at the key metrics in a side-by-side comparison. Use this feature to determine which version of a model is the best one to send to production or which model might need work:

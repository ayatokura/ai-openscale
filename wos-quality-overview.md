# Quality metrics overview
{: #anlz_metrics}

Use quality monitoring to determine how well your model predicts outcomes. When quality monitoring is enabled, it generates a set of metrics every hour by default. You can generate these metrics on demand by clicking the **Check quality now** button or by using the Python client.
{: shortdesc}

Quality metrics are calculated based on the following information:

- manually labeled feedback data,
- monitored deployment responses for these data.

For proper monitoring, feedback data must be logged to {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} on a regular basis. The feedback data can be provided either by using "Add Feedback data" option or using Python client or REST API.

For machine learning engines other than {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}}, such as Microsoft Azure ML Studio, Microsoft Azure ML Service, or Amazon Sagemaker ML quality monitoring creates additional scoring requests on the monitored deployment.
{: note}

You can review all metrics values over time on the {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} dashboard:

## Supported quality details
{: #anlz_metrics_supqualdets_suppr_dets}

The following details for quality metrics are supported by {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}}:

### Confusion matrix
{: #anlz_metrics_supqualdets_confusion-quickovr}

Confusion matrix helps you to understand for which of your feedback data the monitored deployment response is correct and for which it is not.

For more information, see [Confusion matrix](/docs/services/ai-openscale?topic=ai-openscale-it-conf-mtx).

## Next steps

- After {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} detects problems with quality, such as accuracy threshold violations, you must build a new version of the model that fixes the problem. Using the manually labelled data in the feedback table, you must retrain the model along with the original training data.

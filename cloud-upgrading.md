# Upgrading {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} from a lite to a paid plan
{: #cf-upgrade}

You can upgrade {{site.data.keyword.aios_full}} from a free lite plan to a paid plan by using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} dashboard. How do you know it's time to upgrade? If you are getting error messages, such as `403 Errors.AIQFM0011: 'Lite plan has exceeded the 50,000 rows limitation for Debias`.
{: shortdesc}

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}} dashboard, click your avatar.
2. Click **View upgrade options**.
4. Set the **Standard** check box and then click **Upgrade**.

After you upgrade, it takes about 5 minutes to take effect. It is possible to get an error message during this period, however, after the upgrade, any error messages about exceeding limitations desist.

# Configuring event details in {{site.data.keyword.aios_short}}
{: #event-dets-monitor}

After you configure the application monitor and KPIs, you must supply event details to your monitor. You can do this in one of the following ways: by uploading a file with the details or by manually entering the information in the event details table.

## Requirements
{: #event-dets-config-reqs}

On the **Event details** tab, you must provide the following information:

### Transaction ID
{: #event-dets-config-reqs-trxn_id}

The transaction ID field is required to map business key performance indicators (KPIs). It is the unique identifier for the business event. It must be a **text** data type and match exactly the identifier in the business event payload data.

### Timestamp
{: #event-dets-config-reqs-timestamp}

So that data is tracked by date and time, you must provide a timestamp. The timestamp is a required field so that transactions over time can align properly. It must be a **date** data type and match exactly the identifier in the business event payload data.

### Property name
{: #event-dets-config-reqs-property-name}

Enter the propery name as it appears in the business events payload.

### Description
{: #event-dets-config-reqs-descriptionofevent}

Type a free-form description to help you understand the event.

### Data type
{: #event-dets-config-reqs-data-type}

Select a data type from the drop-down box. The data type that you select here must match the data type in the events detail payload.

### Unit label
{: #event-dets-config-reqs-unit-label}

Type a free-form label, such as USD or Euros to provide context to the data.
